## Main Features
- ##### Showing the current temperature, weather conditions, and wind speed of the entered city.
- ##### Displaying the next 3 day forecast including the temperature and wind speed.
- ##### Switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## Usage
Once the web page is opened, enter the name of the city you wish to check the weather for, and the webpage will update its content accordingly :)

### Notes
- The weather app is able to fetch all information for most well-known cities.
- Some cities may have weather data but not country and city names, since these two aspects of the application are being taken care of by different APIs.
- The application should support over 2500 cities worldwide.
